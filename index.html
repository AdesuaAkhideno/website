    <h1><strong>MUSIC</strong></h1>
    <P>Music  is a combination of sound that is pleasant to hear, but peoples <em>taste</em> differ what is 
pleasant to you may not be pleasant to me.That is why we should all find what suits us not rush to 
follow what is in trend</P> <p>Music has evolved along the years bringing us the different  genre of music
we have now.Imagine if the great musicians of each period stuck to what was in trend and did not reach to seek
outside the box we will probably not have all this genre of music</p>
